# Easy Test 

## Description
This plugin was created to help users make better use of their carefully written notes, **prevent them from being neglected**, and ultimately support users learning.

## Features
### Core
-   The plugin extracts bold text (**bold**) from the active editor and converts it into HTML input fields.
-   Displays the converted content in a modal for **easy interaction** ( click the ribbion button or use hotkey ).
-   Then user can enter their answers and check them in real time.

## Learning with Plugins
1. Quickly go through books or materials, underlining key points.
2. Based on underlined key points, create a short Obsidian note.
3. Immediately test what youâ€™ve learned using a plugin.
4. **Test again the next morning.**

Now, in theory, you should keep extending the review intervals (three days, a week, a month), but letâ€™s be honest â€” weâ€™re not that disciplined. ðŸ˜†

Thatâ€™s why I strongly recommend at least reviewing it the next morning. It's the last realistic chance to make it stick. Iâ€™ve tried stretching out the review cycle, but Iâ€™d always forget or just feel pressured and end up doing nothing.

However, reviewing the next morning? That felt easy. No stress, no pressure â€” just a quick test, and surprisingly, the knowledge stuck for quite a long time.

So please (I know I sound like a broken record), donâ€™t skip step 4. As for steps 1, 2, and 3? I have no doubt youâ€™ll do those anyway. ðŸ˜‰
